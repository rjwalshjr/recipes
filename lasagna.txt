Spinach Lasagna by  MARK BITTMAN

INGREDIENTS
12 to 16 dried or fresh lasagna noodles
3 to 4 cups good tomato sauce
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 cups cooked spinach, squeezed dry and chopped (about 1 1/2 pounds fresh)
1 ½ cups ricotta
1 ½ cups coarsely grated mozzarella
2 cups grated Parmesan
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper

PREPARATION

Step 1
If you're using dried pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. If
you're using fresh pasta sheets, cut them into long wide noodles approximately
3 inches by 13 inches, or a size that will fit into your lasagna dish. Cook the
noodles (6 at a time for dried noodles) until they are tender but still
underdone (they will finish cooking as the lasagna bakes); fresh pasta will
take only a minute. Drain and then lay the noodles flat on a towel so they
won't stick.

Step 2
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a rectangular baking dish with the olive
oil, add a large dollop of tomato sauce and spread it around. Put a layer of
noodles (use four) in the dish, trimming any overhanging edges; top with a
layer of tomato sauce, one-third of the spinach, and one-fourth of the ricotta
(use your fingers to spread it evenly), the mozzarella and the Parmesan. Season
with salt and pepper if desired.

Step 3
Repeat the layers twice, and top with the remaining noodles, tomato sauce,
ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan; the top should be covered with cheese; add
more ricotta and Parmesan as needed. (The lasagna may be made ahead to this
point, wrapped tightly and refrigerated for up to a day or frozen. Bring to
room temperature before proceeding.)

Step 4
Bake until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is melted and lightly browned
on top, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest a few minutes
before serving, or cool completely, cover well, and refrigerate for up to 3
days, or freeze.
